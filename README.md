# rock_paper_scissors
We created the game Rock Paper Scissors using Teachable machine from google.

In this the game takes input from the user using webcam.
We trained the teachable machine with three labels "Rock", "Paper" and "Scissors".
The model identifies the input from the user and classify it to one of the three labels.
