# rock_paper_scissors
We created the game Rock Paper Scissors using Teachable machine from google.

Rock Paper Scissors game is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping.
It is a instant hand game.
In this the game takes input from the user using webcam.
We trained the teachable machine with three labels "Rock", "Paper" and "Scissors".
The shapes are "Rock"-> a closed fist, "Paper"-> a flat hand, "Scissors"-> victory symbol(two fingered V shape)
The model identifies the input from the user and classify it to one of the three labels.
